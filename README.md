# Automating-Recommendation-Engine-Training

This code is an example Python script for automating the recommendation engine training process with Amazon Personalize and AWS Glue.

First, it imports the required libraries and initializes boto3 clients for Amazon Personalize and AWS Glue. 
It then specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where the data is stored, the name of the AWS Glue job to preprocess the data, and the output location for the trained model.

The code creates an AWS Glue job to preprocess the data using the specified Glue ETL script. The job is started and its status is monitored until it completes. 
Once the data is preprocessed, the code creates an Amazon Personalize dataset group and schemas for the interaction and item datasets.

The interaction schema describes the structure of the interaction data between users and items, which includes the user ID, item ID, timestamp, and event value. 
The item schema describes the structure of the item data, which includes the item ID and genre.

The next step would be to create datasets from the preprocessed data, import the data into the datasets, and use the datasets to train a recommendation model using Amazon Personalize. 
This code only covers the initial setup steps required for training a recommendation engine with Amazon Personalize and AWS Glue.
